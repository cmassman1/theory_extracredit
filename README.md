Extra Credit: Strengthening Understanding in Theory of Computing

Description
This repository contains an extra credit paper submitted on multiple topics covered in the first unit, 
specifically DFAs and automation conversions. The paper explores key topics in the theory of computing, 
including automata theory, proof techniques, and automaton conversions. The work reflects an effort to 
strengthen conceptual understanding after reflecting on performance in the first exam.

Reason for Selection
I chose to write this paper because I found areas like DFA design, logical reasoning, proof techniques, 
and automaton conversions challenging. Writing this paper helped deepen my understanding of these topics 
through structured explanations and theoretical exploration.

How This Helped
This extra credit project reinforced my understanding of core theoretical concepts in computing. 
It provided an opportunity to revisit complex topics, improve conceptual clarity, and develop stronger 
problem-solving skills through in-depth research and writing.
